I am Rishabh Jain, I use `TGL` as a common handle. this was because i made my Unity account named TheGameLearner. 
I am a Software Developer who has realised that everything is a game, and we need to learn rules to excel at any game, be it work, play, social interactions or anything more.

I will be covering topics like: Unity, linux, NodeJs, etc. depending on what attracts me. This is to help others learning rules like me to to find and learn rules and how to use them easier.
