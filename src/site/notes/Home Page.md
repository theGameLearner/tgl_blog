# Rishabh Jain
I am Rishabh Jain, I use `TGL` as a common handle. this was because i made my Unity account named 'TheGameLearner'. 
I am a Software Developer who has realised that everything is a game, and we need to learn rules to excel at any game, be it work, play, social interactions or anything more.

I will be covering topics like: Unity, linux, NodeJs, homelab, etc. depending on what attracts me. This is to help others learning rules like me. This is also like a cheat sheet for me to quickly refer how I did something in past.

### About me
#### Personally
I come from 'Odisha' but do not know 'Odia'
I am 31 year old and currently living in Benguluru.
I am an introvert so please try to reach out to me via text.
I am always trying something new, I may not always share what.😉
