I wanted a way to create my resume with more than what word provided without having to make the doc as an image that cannot be updated at will. I am not an artist, and even though I like to make stuff, learning to draw for documents does not seem ideal. 
I went down the rabbit hole and found a DTP tool that I can work with - **Inkspace**.

Pros:
- free
- open source
- App Image to run on linux
Cons:
- each doc will take a long time, specially when I am not an artist.

But I was able to use it to re-make my logo, as well as my resume, so happy to share about it.
